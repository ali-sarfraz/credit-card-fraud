# Credit Fraud Detection Study

This study aims to define and utilize alternate performance metrics, like precision and recall, for evaluating the
performance of various classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, polynomial regression,
support vector machines, and random forests, tuned to their optimal conditions. These models are then tested using
the alternative evaluation metrics for classifying fraudulent cases in the biased dataset.

The evaluation shows that the best algorithm to use for identifying
fraudulent credit-card uses is the random forest, which yielded a
maximum precision rating of 78.5%.
